        <p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los
            Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been
            based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos,
            instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four"
            bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current
            lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich,
            longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave
            Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and
            bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986)
            and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.</p>
        <p>Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won
            critical acclaim with its first five albums. The band's third album, Master of
            Puppets (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash
            metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first to
            root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience,
            achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the
            United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.
            After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases,
            the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album,
            Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier
            albums.</p>
        <p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service
            Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the
            service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after
            reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was
            the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,
            which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album,
            St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009,
            Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the
            screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica: Through the
            Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.</p>

        <h2>Style and lyrical themes</h2>
        <p>Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black
            Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush,
            Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Scorpions and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM)
            bands Venom, Motörhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden. Early
            punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's
            style as did post-punk band Killing Joke and hardcore punk acts Discharge and
            Suicidal Tendencies. The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized
            leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the
            Lightning featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".
            Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression
            to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with
            personal and socially conscious issues. Religious and military leaders, rage,
            insanity, monsters, and drugs—among other themes—were explored on Master of
            Puppets .</p>
        <p>In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined
            its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert
            Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to
            expand its music and expressive range. The change in direction proved commercially
            successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the
            Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge
            movement of the early 1990s. In Load—an album that has been described as having
            "an almost alternative rock" approach—the band changed musical direction and
            focused on non-metal influences. Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from
            drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and
            critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art
            of Load, and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996. David Fricke of
            Rolling Stone described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end
            Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996. With
            the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock
            influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.</p>
        <p>St. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were
            excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound". The band used drop
            C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's
            Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with
            Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug
            themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of
            producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned
            to standard tuning and guitar solos. As a return to Metallica's thrash roots,
            Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle
            lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.</p>

        <p>Metallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time,
            and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer,
            Anthrax, and Megadeth. The band has sold more than 125 million records worldwide,
            including an RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58,000,000
            in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all
            time. The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica
            gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge". Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato
            of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and
            volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured
            compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal
            band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".</p>
        <p>Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said,
            "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the
            years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest
            bands ever." Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest
            influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years
            old—I'd never heard anything that heavy". Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of
            Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening,
            "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that
            album Master of Puppets—and the staying power—a timeless record like that".
            Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard
            Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar. M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold
            said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said,
            "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting
            your idols Metallica". God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired
            by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton
            as a "rocker". Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica
            releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'", and Adema drummer
            Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.</p>
        <p>On April 4, 2009, Metallica were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.
            They entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the second year they were eligible
            and first year they were nominated. Metallica's induction into the Hall included
            its current lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo, and Lars
            Ulrich, and former members Jason Newsted and Cliff Burton.</p>
